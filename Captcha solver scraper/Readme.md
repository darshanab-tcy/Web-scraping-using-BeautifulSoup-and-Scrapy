# CAPTCHA-Aware Web Scraping

This module demonstrates how CAPTCHA handling can be integrated into a web scraping pipeline.

The focus of this notebook is **exploratory learning**, showing how a scraper can:
- Detect CAPTCHA challenges.
- Pause execution when CAPTCHA is encountered.
- Integrate with third-party CAPTCHA solving services (e.g., 2Captcha).
- Retry requests after CAPTCHA resolution.

---

## Objective

The goal is to understand **where and how CAPTCHA handling fits** into automated scraping workflows, not to aggressively bypass protections.

This project is intended for:
- Learning scraping control flows.
- Understanding CAPTCHA-aware pipeline design.
- Exploring third-party solver APIs in a controlled setup.

---

## Workflow Overview

1. Send request to target page. 
2. Check HTTP response. 
3. Detect CAPTCHA presence.  
4. Extract CAPTCHA metadata (e.g., site-key).
5. Submit CAPTCHA to solver API.  
6. Poll for solution token.  
7. Retry request with solution.  
8. Continue scraping if successful.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- requests
- BeautifulSoup
- 2Captcha API (exploratory integration)

---

## Important Notes

- This notebook does **not target real protected websites**.
- CAPTCHA solving is demonstrated conceptually.
- Actual execution requires valid API credits.
- Ethical scraping practices are followed throughout.

---

## Status

This module is currently in **exploration phase**.  
Further refinements may include:
- Better CAPTCHA detection heuristics.
- Headless browser integration.
- Rate limiting and retry strategies.
