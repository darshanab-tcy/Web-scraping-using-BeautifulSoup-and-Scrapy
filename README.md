# Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup and Scrapy

This repository demonstrates web scraping techniques using **BeautifulSoup** and **Scrapy** in Python.  
The project focuses on extracting structured data from a publicly available website and exporting it to CSV format.

---

## Objectives
- Demonstrate static web scraping using BeautifulSoup.
- Implement pagination handling.
- Demonstrate scalable scraping using Scrapy.
- Store scraped data in structured CSV files.

---

## Website Used
- https://quotes.toscrape.com  
This website is intended for scraping practice and does not require authentication.
---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- Scrapy
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## BeautifulSoup Scraping
- Sends HTTP requests to static web pages.
- Parses HTML using BeautifulSoup.
- Extracts quote text, author, and tags.
- Handles pagination by detecting "Next" links.
- Saves results to CSV using Pandas.

---

## Scrapy Scraping
- Uses Scrapy spider for structured crawling.
- Automatically handles pagination.
- Faster and more scalable than manual scraping.
- Outputs data directly to CSV.

---

## Output Data
- Quote text
- Author name
- Associated tags

---

## Notes
- This project focuses on **static web scraping**.
- No browser automation was used.

---

## Key Takeaways
- BeautifulSoup is suitable for simple to medium scraping tasks.
- Scrapy is preferred for larger, scalable scraping pipelines.
- Proper project structure and version control are essential.

## CAPTCHA-Aware Scraping (Exploratory)

This repository also includes an **exploratory CAPTCHA-aware scraping module** located in:

`Captcha solver scraper/`

This module demonstrates:
- CAPTCHA detection in scraping workflows
- Integration points for third-party solver services (e.g., 2Captcha)
- Request retry logic after CAPTCHA resolution

📄 Detailed documentation for this module is available in the  
**README inside the `Captcha solver scraper` folder**.

## Legal & Ethical Disclaimer

This repository contains web scraping examples using BeautifulSoup and Scrapy for educational and demonstration purposes only.

All examples operate on publicly accessible demo data and do not involve scraping private, sensitive, or authenticated content.
